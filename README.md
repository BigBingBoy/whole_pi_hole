# whole_pi_hole
Pi-Hole server with Pi Zero WH and Adafruit 135x240 Mini PiTFT display. Edited stats.py to include default to display backlight off and single and double button press actions. 
Thanks to https://github.com/BTJ01/IoT-Projects/tree/master/Pi-Hole for the backlight off code and Adafruit for the kit & tutorial https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Pi_Hole_Ad_Blocker/
