# whole_pi_hole
Pi-Hole server with Pi Zero WH and Adafruit 135x240 Mini PiTFT display. Edited stats.py to include default to display backlight off and respond to single and double button press. 
Thanks to https://github.com/BTJ01/IoT-Projects for the backlight off code and Adafruit for the parts and original tutorial code https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Pi_Hole_Ad_Blocker/
