# whole_pi_hole
As a DIY project during the pandemic, I put together 2 Pi-Hole servers.

Pi Zero WH, Adafruit 135x240 and 240x240 Mini PiTFT displays. Edited stats.py to include default to display backlight off and single and double button press actions. 

Thanks to https://github.com/BTJ01/IoT-Projects/tree/master/Pi-Hole for the backlight off code and Adafruit for the kit & tutorial https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/blob/master/Pi_Hole_Ad_Blocker/  

Used PuTTY to ssh and WinSCP to FTP.
